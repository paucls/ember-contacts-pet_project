Paulo Clavijo 2014.

## Getting Started

Using NPM we will install the development dependencies [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

```shell
npm install
```

Next step is running Bower to install the app dependencies.

```shell
bower install
```

Finally we use Gulp to concatenate scripts and compile templates.

```shell
gulp
```

To run tests:

```shell
karma start
```
